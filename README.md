# MS274-ClassProject
Class project using CDIP MOP nearshore model output and CERC equation to investigate longshore transport gradients and shoreline change in N. Monterey Bay.

The main file in this repository, 'NorthernMontereyBayCERC' contains the code necessary to load in data collected from the CDIP MOPs THREDDs data server and stored in CSVs. This file also builds a CERC model to quantify longshore sediment transport volume and direction as well as associated cross-shore shoreline adjustment due to variations in alongshore sediment transport using the Bruun Rule. 

To run: clone this repository and the files at the google drive link below into a folder on your computer.
